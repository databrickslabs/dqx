# Motivation

Current data quality frameworks often fall short in providing detailed explanations for specific row or column 
data quality issues and are primarily designed for complete datasets, 
making integration into streaming workloads difficult.

This project introduces a simple Python validation framework for assessing data quality of PySpark DataFrames. 
It enables real-time quality validation during data processing rather than relying solely on post-factum monitoring.
The validation output includes detailed information on why specific rows and columns have issues, 
allowing for quicker identification and resolution of data quality problems.

</div>

Invalid data can be quarantined to make sure bad data is never written to the output.

</div>


In the Lakehouse architecture, the validation of new data should happen at the time of data entry into the Curated Layer 
to make sure bad data is not propagated to the subsequent layers. With DQX you can easily quarantine invalid data and re-ingest it 
after curation to ensure that data quality constraints are met.

For monitoring the data quality of already persisted data in a Delta table (post-factum monitoring), we recommend to use 
[Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/index.html).
