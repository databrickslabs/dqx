#  Demos

Import the following notebooks in the Databricks workspace to try DQX out:
## Use as Library
* [DQX Quick Start Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_quick_start_demo_library.py) - quickstart on how to use DQX as a library.
* [DQX Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_library.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library.
* [DQX Demo Notebook for Data Quality Summary Metrics](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_summary_metrics.py) - demonstrates how to generate summary-level data quality metrics when validating data with DQX.
* [DQX Demo Notebook for Profiling and Applying Checks at Scale on Multiple Tables](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_multi_table_demo.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library at scale to apply checks on multiple tables.
* [DQX Demo Notebook for AI-assisted checks generation](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_ai_assisted_checks_generation.py) - demonstrates how to generate DQX rules/checks with LLM using natural language.
* [DQX Demo Notebook for Spark Structured Streaming (Native End-to-End Approach)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_streaming_demo_native.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library with Spark Structured Streaming, using the built-in end-to-end method to handle both reading and writing.
* [DQX Demo Notebook for Spark Structured Streaming (DIY Approach)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_streaming_demo_diy.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library with Spark Structured Streaming, while handling reading and writing on your own outside DQX using Spark API.

* [DQX Demo for dbt](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_dbt/README.md) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library with dbt projects.

## Deploy as Workspace Tool
* [DQX Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_tool.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a tool when installed in the workspace.

## Use Cases
* [DQX for PII Detection Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_demo_pii_detection.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX to check data for Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
* [DQX for Manufacturing Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/v0.10.0/demos/dqx_manufacturing_demo.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX to check data quality for Manufacturing Industry datasets.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Execution Environment">
You don't have to run DQX from a Notebook. DQX can be run from any Python script as long as it runs on Databricks.
For example, you can run it from a Databricks job by adding DQX as a dependent library.
When DQX is installed in the workspace as a tool, it provides a suite of command-line tools for executing DQX jobs (see the [User Guide](/docs/guide)).
