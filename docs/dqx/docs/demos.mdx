#  Demos

Install the [installation](/docs/installation) framework, and import the following notebooks in the Databricks workspace to try it out:
* [DQX Demo Notebook (library)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_demo_library.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library.
* [DQX Demo Notebook (tool)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_demo_tool.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a tool when installed in the workspace.
* [DQX DLT Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_dlt_demo.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX with Delta Live Tables (DLT).

Note that DQX don't have to be run from a Notebook. You can run it from any Python script as long as it runs on Databricks.
For example, you can add DQX as a library to your job or cluster.
