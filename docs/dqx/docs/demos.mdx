<Admonition type="tip" title="Execution Environment">
You don't have to run DQX from a Notebook. DQX can be run from any Python script as long as it runs on Databricks.
For example, you can run it from a Databricks job by adding DQX as a dependent library.
When DQX is installed in the workspace as a tool, it provides a suite of command-line tools for executing DQX jobs (see the [User Guide](/docs/guide)).
