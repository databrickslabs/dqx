<Admonition type="tip" title="Execution Environment">
You don't have to run DQX from a Notebook. DQX can be run from any Python script as long as it runs on Databricks.
For example, you can run it from a Databricks job by adding DQX as a dependent library.
DQX also comes with a set of command-line tools for running DQX jobs (see the [User Guide](/docs/guide)).
