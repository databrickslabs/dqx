#  Demos

Import the following notebooks in the Databricks workspace to try DQX out:
* [DQX Demo Notebook (library)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_demo_library.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a library.
* [DQX Demo Notebook (tool)](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_demo_tool.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX as a tool when installed in the workspace.
* [DQX DLT Demo Notebook](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/blob/main/demos/dqx_dlt_demo.py) - demonstrates how to use DQX with Delta Live Tables (DLT).

<Admonition type="tip" title="Execution Environment">
You don't have to run DQX from a Notebook. DQX can be run from any Python script as long as it runs on Databricks.
For example, you can run it from a Databricks job by adding DQX as a dependent library.
DQX comes also with a set of command-line tools that can be used to run DQX jobs (see the [User Guide](/docs/guide)).
