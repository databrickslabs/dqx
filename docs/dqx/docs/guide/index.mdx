## Integration and execution options

### Supported quality checking types

| Quality checking type | Integration with processing pipelines | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In-transit**        | Code-level only                       | DQX allows data quality to be validated on the fly while the data is being processed, before it is written to storage. This requires DQX to be used as a library and integrated directly into user pipelines.  |
| **At-rest**           | Code-level or No-code (Workflows)     | DQX enables data quality checking on existing data stored in tables. For no-code integration, DQX must first be installed in the workspace as a tool to deploy workflows.                                      |

### Integration options

| **Profiling and quality checks generation** | Programmatic approach (Code-level integration)                          | Use methods of `DQXProfiler` and `DQGenerator` or `DQDltGenerator` classes.                 | Profile input data and generate quality rules candidates. `DQEngine` can be used to save the generated checks to a storage.

For more details, see the [Applying Checks Guide](/docs/guide/quality_checks_apply/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Quality Checking**                        | No-code approach (Workflow). Requires installation as a workspace tool. | Use `quality-checker` and `e2e` workflows (triggered from Databricks CLI or Databricks UI). | Offers quality checker workflow (load checks > apply checks > save results) and e2e (end-to-end) workflow (profile input data and generate quality checks > apply checks > save results). Input and output data, and quality checks storage configured in the [configuration file](/docs/installation/#configuration-file). By default, the workflow runs for all defined run configs, but it can be parameterized to target a specific run config or wildcard patterns. For more details, see the [Applying Checks Guide](/docs/guide/quality_checks_apply/#no-code-approach-workflows).   |

The no-code approach using Workflows will be preferred for less technical users wanting to run quality checks on existing data stored in tables. It provides a user-friendly interface to execute quality checks without needing to write any code.
The code-level approach is more flexible and allows for more complex scenarios, such as integrating quality checks directly into data processing pipelines.

## Defining quality rules (checks)

Quality rules can be defined in the following ways:
- As YAML or JSON files stored locally, in a Databricks Workspace, or in a Unity Catalog Volume, or as rows stored in a table. See more details in [Quality Checks Storage Guide](/docs/guide/quality_checks_storage).
- Programmatically as a list of dictionary objects (can also be loaded from YAML or JSON definitions).
- Programmatically as a list of `DQRule` objects.

Additionally, quality rule candidates can be auto-generated using the DQX profiler.

For more details, see the [Quality Checks Definition Guide](/docs/guide/quality_checks_definition).
