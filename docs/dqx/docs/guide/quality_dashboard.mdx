# Quality Dashboard

The data quality dashboard is automatically installed in the `dashboards` folder of the workspace installation directory when you install DQX in the Databricks workspace. For more details on the installation process, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

The dashboard lets you monitor and track data quality issues easily. You can customize them to align with your specific requirements.

The dashboard is not scheduled to refresh automatically by default, minimizing concerns regarding associated cluster costs. When you open a dashboard, refresh it manually to view the latest data. However, as needed, you can configure the dashboard to [refresh periodically](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dashboards/index.html#schedules-and-subscriptions).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI" default>
    You can locate the dashboard using Databricks workspace UI directly or use the following command:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
    ```

    After executing the command:
    * Locate and click on a dashboard file in the workspace UI.
    * Open the dashboard and click `Refresh` to load the latest data.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    You can locate the dashboard using Databricks workspace UI directly or use the following code:
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.contexts.workspace import WorkspaceContext

    ctx = WorkspaceContext(WorkspaceClient())
    dashboards_folder_link = f"{ctx.installation.workspace_link('')}dashboards/"
    print(f"Open a dashboard from the following folder and refresh it:")
    print(dashboards_folder_link)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Dashboard configuration">
DQX dashboard(s) only use the quarantined table for queries as defined in `config.yml` during installation.
If you change the quarantine table in the run config after the deployment (`quarantine_table` field), you must update the dashboard queries accordingly.
