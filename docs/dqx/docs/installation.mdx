# Installation

The framework can be installed on a Databricks workspace or used as a standalone library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later. See [instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Unity Catalog-enabled [Databricks workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html).
- Network access to your Databricks Workspace used for the installation process.
- (Optional) Databricks CLI v0.213 or later. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html).
- Databricks Runtime with Spark 3.5.0 or higher. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html).


## Installation as a Library

Install the project via `pip`:

```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx
```

## Installation in a Databricks Workspace

### Authentication

Once you install Databricks CLI, authenticate your current machine to your Databricks Workspace:

```commandline
databricks auth login --host <WORKSPACE_HOST>
```

To enable debug logs, simply add `--debug` flag to any command.
More about authentication options [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication.html).

### Install DQX in the Databricks workspace

Install DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs install dqx
```

You'll be prompted to select a [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication) created by `databricks auth login` command,
and other configuration options.

The cli command will install the following components in the workspace:
- A Python [wheel file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) with the library packaged.
- DQX configuration file (`config.yml`).
- Profiling workflow for generating quality rule candidates.
- Quality dashboard for monitoring to display information about the data quality issues (not scheduled by default).

DQX configuration file can contain multiple run configurations defining specific set of input, output and quarantine locations etc.
During the installation the "default" run configuration is created.

You can add additional run configurations after the installation by editing the `config.yml` file in the installation directory on the Databricks workspace:
```yaml
log_level: INFO
run_config:
- name: default
  checks_file: checks.yml
  curated_location: main.dqx.curated
  input_location: main.dqx.input
  output_location: main.dqx.output
  profile_summary_stats_file: profile_summary_stats.yml
  quarantine_location: main.dqx.quarantine
- name: another_run_config
  ...
```

To select a specific run config when executing the dqx labs cli commands use `--run-config` parameter. 
When not provided the "default" run config is used.

By default, DQX is installed in the user home directory (under `/Users/<user>/.dqx`). You can also install DQX globally
by setting 'DQX_FORCE_INSTALL' environment variable. The following options are available:

* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for root only (`/Applications/dqx`)
* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=user databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for user only (`/Users/<user>/.dqx`)

To list all installed dqx workflows in the workspace and their latest run state, execute the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx workflows
```

### Install the tool on the Databricks cluster

After you install the tool on the workspace, you need to install the DQX package on a Databricks cluster.
You can install the DQX library either from PYPI or use a wheel file generated as part of the installation in the workspace.

There are multiple ways to install libraries in a Databricks cluster (see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/libraries/index.html)).
For example, you can install DQX directly from a notebook cell as follows:
```python
# using PYPI package:
%pip install databricks-labs-dqx

# using wheel file, DQX installed for the current user:
%pip install /Workspace/Users/<user-name>/.dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl

# using wheel file, DQX installed globally:
%pip install /Applications/dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl
```

Restart the kernel after the package is installed in the notebook:
```python
# in a separate cell run:
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

### Upgrade DQX in the Databricks workspace

Verify that DQX is installed:

```commandline
databricks labs installed
```

Upgrade DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs upgrade dqx
```

### Uninstall DQX from the Databricks workspace

Uninstall DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs uninstall dqx
```

Databricks CLI will confirm a few options:
- Whether you want to remove all dqx artefacts from the workspace as well. Defaults to 'no'.
