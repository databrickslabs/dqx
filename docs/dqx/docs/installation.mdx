# Installation

The framework can be installed on a Databricks workspace as a tool or used as a standalone library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later. See [instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- [Databricks workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html).
- Network access to your Databricks Workspace used for the installation process.
- (Optional if wanting to install DQX as a tool) Databricks CLI v0.241 or later. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html).
- Databricks cluster with Spark 3.5.0 or higher. It is recommended to use Databricks Runtime >= 15.4. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html).

## DQX installation as a Library

Install the library via `pip` in a cluster or notebook:
```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx
```

As a best practice, you should always pin the version so that your code is not affected by future changes in the library:
```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx==0.8.0
```

DQX also integrates seamlessly with Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB).
You can add DQX as a [library dependency](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/library-dependencies#pypi-package) in your DAB configuration to install it on your cluster:
```yaml
resources:
  jobs:
    my_job:
      # ...
      tasks:
        - task_key: my_task
          # ...
          libraries:
            - pypi:
                package: databricks-labs-dqx==0.8.0
```

## DQX installation as a Tool in a Databricks Workspace

If you install DQX via PyPI and use it purely as a library, you don’t need to pre-install DQX in the workspace.
However, installing DQX in the workspace offers additional benefits such as profiling and quality checker workflows allowing for no-code quality checking, a pre-configured dashboard, and convenient configuration management.

### Authenticate Databricks CLI

Once you install Databricks CLI, authenticate your current machine to your Databricks Workspace:

```commandline
databricks auth login --host <WORKSPACE_HOST>
```

To enable debug logs, simply add `--debug` flag to any command.
More about authentication options [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication.html).

### Install DQX using Databricks CLI

Install DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI:
```commandline
databricks labs install dqx
```

You'll be prompted to provide several configuration options.
You can use standard Databricks CLI options like `--profile` for authentication.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Execution Environment">
* Make sure to have Databricks CLI v0.241 or later installed locally to avoid encountering the error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyspark'.
* You must have Python 3.10 or later to install DQX using the Databricks Labs CLI.
The Databricks Labs CLI relies on the user's Python installation to create a virtual environment and install the required DQX packages. The packages (e.g. pyspark) don't have to be installed locally before running the CLI.
* Running the Databricks CLI from within a Databricks workspace is not supported. The CLI is designed for use from a local machine or a separate compute environment, not directly inside Databricks.
* The CLI supports the private PyPI package index. If you encounter SSL-related errors, you may need to install OpenSSL on your system or reinstall Python.
</Admonition>

Install a specific version of DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI (e.g. version 0.8.0):
```commandline
databricks labs install dqx@v0.8.0
```

You'll be prompted to select a [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication) created by `databricks auth login` command, and other configuration options.

The cli command will install the following components in the workspace installation folder:
- A Python [wheel file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) with the library packaged.
- DQX configuration file (`config.yml`).
- Profiling workflow for generating quality rule candidates (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)
- Quality checking workflow to apply quality rules to the data (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)
- End-to-end (e2e) workflow to profile input data, generate quality checks and apply them to the data (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)
- Quality dashboard for monitoring to display information about the data quality issues (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)

During the installation you will be prompted to select whether to use serverless clusters or not.
It is recommended to use serverless clusters for the workflows, as it allows for automated cluster management and scaling.
If serverless clusters are not used, a default cluster configuration will be used for the workflows.
Alternatively, you can override the cluster configuration for each workflow in the `config.yml` file after the installation, to provide existing clusters to use.

#### Installation Options

DQX offers flexible installation options. By default, DQX is installed in the user home directory under `/Users/<user>/.dqx`.
You can also install DQX in a global folder or any custom workspace folder.

**Environment Variable Override:**

You can force global or user installation using the 'DQX_FORCE_INSTALL' environment variable:
  * `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global databricks labs install dqx`: forces installation to `/Applications/dqx`
  * `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=user databricks labs install dqx`: forces installation to `/Users/<user>/.dqx` (default behaviour)

**Custom Workspace Folder:**

If you provide a custom path during installation (e.g., `/Shared/dqx-team` or `/Users/shared-user/dqx-project`), DQX will be installed there.
You will be prompted to optionally enter a workspace path when installing DQX.

The custom folder installation is required when using [Group Assigned cluster](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/compute/group-access),
as the concept of a user home directory does not exist in this setup.

<Admonition type="info" title="Complete Profiling Guide">
If a custom folder is provided during installation, the installation folder will take precedence over any environment variables (e.g. `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL`).
</Admonition> 

#### Configuration file

DQX configuration file can contain multiple run configurations for different pipelines or projects, each defining specific input, output and quarantine locations, etc.
The configuration file is created in the installation directory depending on installation options (see above):
- User home (default): `/Users/<user>/.dqx/config.yml`
- Global: `/Applications/dqx/config.yml` (when DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global)
- Custom folder: `<your-installation-folder>/config.yml` (when provided during installation)

A "default" run configuration is created during the installation. When DQX is upgraded, the configuration is preserved.
The configuration can be updated / extended manually by the user after the installation. Each run config defines configuration for one specific input and output location.

Open the configuration file:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-remote-config
```

You can add additional run configurations (under `run_configs` field) or update the default run configuration after the installation by editing the `config.yml` file.
See the example config below with all configuration options:

```

Use the `—-run-config` parameter to specify a particular run configuration when executing DQX Labs CLI commands. If no configuration is provided, the "default" run configuration is used.

#### Workflows

Profiling workflow is intended as a one-time operation. It is not scheduled by default, ensuring no costs are incurred.

List all installed workflows in the workspace and their latest run state:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx workflows
```

#### Dashboard

DQX data quality dashboard is deployed to the installation directory.
The dashboard is not scheduled to refresh by default, ensuring no costs are incurred.

Open dashboard:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Dashboard configuration">
DQX dashboard(s) only use the quarantined table for queries as defined in `config.yml` during installation.
If you change the quarantine table in the run config after the deployment (`quarantine_table` field), you must update the dashboard queries accordingly.
</Admonition>

### Install DQX on Databricks cluster

You need to install the DQX package on a Databricks cluster to use it.
You can install it either from PYPI or use a wheel file generated during the installation in the workspace.

There are multiple ways to install libraries in a Databricks cluster (see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/libraries/index.html)).
For example, you can install DQX directly from a notebook cell as follows:
```python
# Using PYPI package
%pip install databricks-labs-dqx==0.8.0

# Using wheel file, DQX installed for the current user:
%pip install /Workspace/Users/<user-name>/.dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl

# Using wheel file, DQX installed globally:
%pip install /Applications/dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl
```

Restart the kernel after the package is installed in the notebook:
```python
# in a separate cell run:
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

DQX also integrates seamlessly with Databricks Asset Bundles (DAB).
You can add DQX as a [library dependency](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/bundles/library-dependencies) in your DAB configuration (either by using PYPI package or a wheel file) to install it on your cluster:
```yaml
resources:
  jobs:
    my_job:
      # ...
      tasks:
        - task_key: my_task
          # ...
          libraries:
            # install from wheel file
            - whl: /Workspace/Users/<user-name>/.dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl
            # or install from pypi
            #- pypi:
            #    package: databricks-labs-dqx==0.8.0
```

### Upgrade DQX in the Databricks workspace

Verify that DQX is installed:

```commandline
databricks labs installed
```

Upgrade DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs upgrade dqx
```

### Uninstall DQX from the Databricks workspace

Uninstall DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs uninstall dqx
```

Databricks CLI will confirm a few options:
- Whether you want to remove all DQX artifacts from the workspace or not. Defaults to 'no'.
