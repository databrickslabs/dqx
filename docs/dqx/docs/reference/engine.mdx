# DQX Engine

To perform data quality checking with DQX, you need to create `DQEngine` object.
The engine requires a Databricks [workspace client](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/sdk-python) for authentication and interaction with the Databricks workspace.

When running the code on a Databricks workspace, the workspace client is automatically authenticated, whether DQX is used in a notebook, script, or as part of a job/workflow.
You only need the following code to create the workspace client if you run DQX on Databricks workspace:
```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

ws = WorkspaceClient()
dq_engine = DQEngine(ws)
```

For external environments, such as CI servers or local machines, you can authenticate to Databricks using any method supported by the Databricks SDK. For detailed instructions, refer to the [default authentication flow](https://databricks-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html#default-authentication-flow).
If you're using Databricks [configuration profiles](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#configuration-profiles) or Databricks-specific [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#environment-variables) for authentication, you can easily create the workspace client without needing to provide additional arguments:
```python
ws = WorkspaceClient()
```

Information on testing applications that use `DQEngine` can be found [here](/docs/reference/testing).
