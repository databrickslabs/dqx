## Data Profiling and Quality Rules Generation

Data profiling can be run to profile the input data and generate quality rule candidates with summary statistics.
The generated rules/checks are input for the quality checking (see [Adding quality checks to the application](#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).
In addition, the DLT generator can be used to generated native Delta Live Tables (DLT) expectations.

Note that profiling and generating quality rule candidates is normally a one-time operation for you input data
and is executed as needed.

### In Python

Profiling and generating DQX rules/checks:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler import DQProfiler
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.generator import DQGenerator
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.dlt_generator import DQDltGenerator
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

ws = WorkspaceClient()
profiler = DQProfiler(ws)
summary_stats, profiles = profiler.profile(df)

# generate DQX quality rules/checks
generator = DQGenerator(ws)
checks = generator.generate_dq_rules(profiles)  # with default level "error"

# save checks in a workspace
dq_engine = DQEngine(ws)
dq_engine.save_checks_in_workspace_file(checks, workspace_path="/Shared/App1/checks.yml")

# save checks to location specified in the run config (only works if DQX is installed in the workspace)
dq_engine.save_checks(checks, run_config_name="default")

# generate DLT expectations
dlt_generator = DQDltGenerator(ws)
dlt_expectations = dlt_generator.generate_dlt_rules(profiles)
```

### Using CLI 

You must install DQX in the workspace before (see [installation](/docs/installation#installation-in-a-databricks-workspace)).
As part of the installation, profiler workflow is installed. It can be run manually in the workspace UI or using the CLI as below.

Run profiler workflow:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile --run-config "default"
```

You will find the generated quality rule candidates and summary statistics in the installation folder as defined in the run config.
If run config is not provided, the "default" run config will be used. The run config is used to select specific run configuration from the 'config.yml'.

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' are used:
- 'input_location': input data as a path or a table.
- 'input_format': input data format. Required if input data is a path.
- 'checks_file': relative location of the generated quality rule candidates (default: `checks.yml`).
- 'profile_summary_stats_file': relative location of the summary statistics (default: `profile_summary.yml`).

Logs are be printed in the console and saved in the installation folder.
To show the saved logs from the latest profiler workflow run, visit the Databricks workspace UI or execute the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx logs --workflow profiler
```

## Validating quality rules (checks)

If you manually adjust the generated rules or create your own configuration, you can validate them before using:

### In Python

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

status = DQEngine.validate_checks(checks)
print(status)
```

The checks validated automatically when applied as part of the 
`apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods 
(see [Quality rules defined as config](#quality-rules-defined-as-config)).

### Using CLI

Validate checks stored in the installation folder:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx validate-checks --run-config "default"
```

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' will be used by default:
- 'checks_file': relative location of the quality rule (default: `checks.yml`).

## Adding quality checks to the application

### Quality rules defined as config

Quality rules can be stored in `yaml` or `json` file. Below an example `yaml` file defining checks ('checks.yml'):
```yaml
- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null
    arguments:
      col_names:
      - col1
      - col2
- name: col_col3_is_null_or_empty
  criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
    arguments:
      col_name: col3
- criticality: warn
  check:
    function: value_is_in_list
    arguments:
      col_name: col4
      allowed:
      - 1
      - 2
```
Fields:
- `criticality`: either "error" (data going only into "bad/quarantine" dataframe) or "warn" (data going into both dataframes).
- `check`: column expression containing "function" (check function to apply), "arguments" (check function arguments), and "col_name" (column name as str to apply to check for) or "col_names" (column names as array to apply the check for). 
- (optional) `name` for the check: autogenerated if not provided.

#### Loading and execution methods

**Method 1: load checks from a workspace file in the installation folder**

If DQX is installed in the workspace, the config contains path to the checks file:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

# use check file specified in the default run configuration in the global installation config ('config.yml')
# can optionally specify the run config and whether to use user installation
checks = dq_engine.load_checks(assume_user=True)

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

Check are validated automatically as part of the `apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods.

**Method 2: load checks from a workspace file**

The checks can also be loaded from any file in the Databricks workspace:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_workspace_file("/Shared/App1/checks.yml")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

**Method 3: load checks from a local file**

The checks can also be loaded from a file in the local file system:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = DQEngine.load_checks_from_local_file("checks.yml")
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

### Quality rules defined as code

**Method 1: using DQX classes**

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, value_is_in_list
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine, DQRuleColSet, DQRule
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = DQRuleColSet( # define rule for multiple columns at once
            columns=["col1", "col2"], 
            criticality="error", 
            check_func=is_not_null).get_rules() + [
         DQRule( # define rule for a single column
            name='col3_is_null_or_empty',
            criticality='error', 
            check=is_not_null_and_not_empty('col3')),
         DQRule( # name auto-generated if not provided       
            criticality='warn', 
            check=value_is_in_list('col4', ['1', '2']))
        ]

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](/docs/reference#quality-rules--functions).

**Method 2: using yaml config**

```python
import yaml
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = yaml.safe_load("""
- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "is_not_null"
    arguments:
      col_names:
        - "col1"
        - "col2"

- criticality: "error"
  check:
    function: "is_not_null_and_not_empty"
    arguments:
      col_name: "col3"

- criticality: "warn"
  check:
    function: "value_is_in_list"
    arguments:
      col_name: "col4"
      allowed:
        - 1
        - 2
""")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](/docs/reference/#quality-rules--functions).

### Integration with DLT (Delta Live Tables)

DLT provides [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/expectations.html) to enforce data quality constraints. However, expectations don't offer detailed insights into why certain checks fail.
The example below demonstrates how to integrate DQX checks with DLT to provide comprehensive information on why quality checks failed.
The integration does not use expectations but the DQX checks directly.

**Option 1: apply quality rules and quarantine bad records**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = ... # quality rules / checks

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get rows without errors or warnings, and drop auxiliary columns
  return dq_engine.get_valid(df)

@dlt.table
def quarantine():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get only rows with errors or warnings
  return dq_engine.get_invalid(df)
```

**Option 2: apply quality rules as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = ... # quality rules / checks
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  return df
```

## Data Quality Dashboard

The Data Quality Dashboard is automatically installed in `dashboards` folder in the workspace installation directory when you install DQX in a Databricks workspace. For more details on the installation process, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

The Data Quality Dashboards let you monitor and track data quality issues easily. You can customize the dashboard to align with your specific requirements.

By default, the dashboard is not scheduled to refresh automatically. When you open it, you need to refresh it manually to view the latest data. However, you can configure the dashboard to [refresh periodically](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dashboards/index.html#schedules-and-subscriptions) by scheduling it as needed.

To navigate to the dashboard directory in the workspace UI, use the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
```

After executing the command:
* Locate and click on the dashboard file in the workspace UI.
* Open the dashboard, and click Refresh to load the latest data.
