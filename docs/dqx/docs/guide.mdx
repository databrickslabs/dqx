## Data Profiling and Quality Rules Generation

Data profiling can be run to profile the input data and generate quality rule candidates with summary statistics.
The generated data quality rules (checks) candidates can be used as input for the quality checking (see [Adding quality checks to the application](#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).
In addition, the DLT generator can generate native Delta Live Tables (DLT) expectations.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Data profiling usage">
Data profiling is typically performed as a one-time action for the input dataset to discover the initial set of quality rule candidates.
The check candidates should be manually reviewed before being applied to the data.
This is not intended to be a continuously repeated or scheduled process, thereby also minimizing concerns regarding compute intensity and associated costs.

    Profiling and generating DQX rules/checks:

    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler import DQProfiler
    from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.generator import DQGenerator
    from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.dlt_generator import DQDltGenerator
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # profile input data
    ws = WorkspaceClient()
    profiler = DQProfiler(ws)
    summary_stats, profiles = profiler.profile(input_df)

    # generate DQX quality rules/checks
    generator = DQGenerator(ws)
    checks = generator.generate_dq_rules(profiles)  # with default level "error"

    dq_engine = DQEngine(ws)

    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">
    You can optionally install DQX in the workspace (see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation#dqx-installation-as-a-tool-in-a-databricks-workspace)).
    A config, dashboard, and profiler workflow are installed as part of the installation. The workflow can be run manually in the workspace UI or using the CLI as below.

    DQX operates exclusively at the PySpark dataframe level and does not interact directly with databases or storage systems.
    DQX does not persist data after performing quality checks, meaning users must handle data storage themselves.
    Since DQX does not manage the input location, output table, or quarantine table, it is the user's responsibility to store or persist the processed data as needed.

    Open the config to check available run configs and adjust the settings if needed:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx open-remote-config
    ```

    See the example config below:
    ```yaml
    log_level: INFO
    version: 1
    run_configs:
    - name: default                         # <- unique name of the run config (default used during installation)
      input_location: s3://iot-ingest/raw   # <- Input location for profiling (UC table or cloud path)
      input_format: delta                   # <- format, required if cloud path provided
      output_table: main.iot.silver         # <- output UC table used in quality dashboard
      quarantine_table: main.iot.quarantine # <- quarantine UC table used in quality dashboard
      checks_file: iot_checks.yml           # <- relative location of the quality rules (checks) defined as json or yaml
      profile_summary_stats_file: iot_profile_summary_stats.yml # <- relative location of profiling summary stats
      warehouse_id: your-warehouse-id       # <- warehouse id for refreshing dashboard
    - name: another_run_config              # <- unique name of the run config
      ...
    ```

    Run profiler workflow:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx profile --run-config "default"
    ```

    The generated quality rule candidates and summary statistics will be in the installation folder, as defined in the run config.
    The "default" run config will be used if the run config is not provided. The run config is used to select specific run configuration from the 'config.yml'.

    The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' is used by the profiler workflow:
    - 'input_location': input data as a path or a table.
    - 'input_format': input data format. Required if input data is a path.
    - 'checks_file': relative location of the generated quality rule candidates as `yaml` or `json` file inside the installation folder (default: `checks.yml`).
    - 'profile_summary_stats_file': relative location of the summary statistics (default: `profile_summary.yml`) inside the installation folder.

    Logs are printed in the console and saved in the installation folder.
    You can display the logs from the latest profiler workflow run by executing:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx logs --workflow profiler
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Adding quality checks to the application

DQX offers a set of predefined quality rules (checks) to leverage. See details and list of all check functions [here](/docs/reference/quality_rules).
Additionally, you can define custom checks to meet specific requirements. Learn more [here](/docs/reference/quality_rules).

### Quality rules configured in a file

Quality rules can be stored in a `yaml` or `json` file. Below is an example `yaml` file ('checks.yml') defining several checks:
```yaml
- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null
    arguments:
      col_names:
      - col1
      - col2
- name: col_col3_is_null_or_empty
  criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
    arguments:
      col_name: col3
- criticality: warn
  check:
    function: is_in_list
    arguments:
      col_name: col4
      allowed:
      - 1
      - 2
```
Fields:
- `criticality`: either "error" (data going only into "bad/quarantine" dataframe) or "warn" (data going into both dataframes).
- `check`: column expression containing "function" (check function to apply), "arguments" (check function arguments), and "col_name" (column name as `str` the check will be applied for) or "col_names" (column names as `array` the check will be applied for).
- (optional) `name` for the check: autogenerated if not provided.

### Loading and execution methods

Checks can be loaded from a file in the installation folder, workspace, or local file system. The engine will raise an error if the checks file contains invalid JSON or YAML definition.

Checks loaded from a file can be applied using one of the following methods:
* `apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split`: splits the input data into valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes.
* `apply_checks_by_metadata`: report issues as additional columns.

Syntax of the loaded checks is validated automatically as part of these methods.
In addition, you can also perform a standalone syntax validation of the checks as described [here](#validating-syntax-of-quality-checks-defined-in-yamljson).

#### Method 1: Loading checks from a workspace file in the installation folder

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
    # load check file specified in the run configuration (if DQX installed in the workspace)
    checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_installation(assume_user=True, run_config_name="default")

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes
    valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

    # Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
    valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Method 2: Loading checks from an arbitrary workspace file

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
    checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_workspace_file(workspace_path="/Shared/App1/checks.yml")

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes
    valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

    # Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
    valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Method 3: Loading checks from a local file

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    checks = DQEngine.load_checks_from_local_file("checks.yml")
    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes
    valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

    # Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
    valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Quality rules defined in code

#### Method 1: Using DQX classes

Checks defined using DQX classes can applied using one of the following methods:
* `apply_checks_and_split`: if you want to split the checked data into valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes.
* `apply_checks`: if you want to report issues as additional columns.

Example:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, is_in_list
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.labs.dqx.rule import DQRuleColSet, DQRule
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient


    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

    checks = [
             DQRule( # define rule for a single column
                name="col3_is_null_or_empty",
                criticality="error",
                check_func=is_not_null_and_not_empty,
                col_name="col3"),
             DQRule( # define rule with a filter
                name="col_4_is_null_or_empty",
                criticality="error", 
                filter="col1 < 3",
                check_func=is_not_null_and_not_empty, 
                col_name="col4"),
             DQRule( # name for the check auto-generated if not provided
                criticality="warn",
                check_func=is_in_list, 
                col_name="col4",
                check_func_args=[["1", "2"]])
            ] + DQRuleColSet( # define rule for multiple columns at once
                columns=["col1", "col2"],
                criticality="error",
                check_func=is_not_null).get_rules()

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes
    valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_and_split(input_df, checks)

    # Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
    valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks(input_df, checks)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Method 2: Using metadata config (yaml/json)

Checks defined as metadata in `yaml` or `json` can applied using one of the following methods:
* `apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split`: if you want to split the checked data into valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes.
* `apply_checks_by_metadata`: if you want to report issues as additional columns.

Example:
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import yaml
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

    checks = yaml.safe_load("""
    - criticality: error
      check:
        function: is_not_null
        arguments:
          col_names:
            - col1
            - col2

    - criticality: error
      check:
        function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
        arguments:
          col_name: col3

    - criticality: error
      filter: col1 < 3
      check:
        function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
        arguments:
          col_name: col4

    - criticality: warn
      check:
        function: is_in_list
        arguments:
          col_name: col4
          allowed:
            - 1
            - 2
    """)

    input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

    # Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes
    valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

    # Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
    valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Integration with DLT (Delta Live Tables)

DLT provides [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/expectations.html) to enforce data quality constraints. However, expectations don't offer detailed insights into why certain checks fail.
The example below demonstrates integrating DQX with DLT to provide comprehensive quality information.
The DQX integration with DLT does not use DLT Expectations but DQX's own methods.

#### Option 1: Apply quality rules and quarantine bad records

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import dlt
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

    checks = ... # quality rules / checks

    @dlt.view
    def bronze_dq_check():
      df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
      return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

    @dlt.table
    def silver():
      df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
      # get rows without errors or warnings, and drop auxiliary columns
      return dq_engine.get_valid(df)

    @dlt.table
    def quarantine():
      df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
      # get only rows with errors or warnings
      return dq_engine.get_invalid(df)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Option 2: Apply quality rules and report issues as additional columns

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import dlt
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

    checks = ... # quality rules / checks
    dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

    @dlt.view
    def bronze_dq_check():
      df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
      return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

    @dlt.table
    def silver():
      df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
      return df
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Validating syntax of quality checks defined in yaml/json

You can validate the syntax of checks defined as metadata in `yaml` or `json` format before applying them. This validation ensures that the checks are correctly defined and can be interpreted by the DQX engine.
The validation cannot be used for checks defined using [DQX classes](#method-1-using-dqx-classes). When checks are defined with DQX classes, syntax validation is unnecessary because the application will fail to interpret them if the DQX objects are constructed incorrectly.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    import yaml
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

    checks = yaml.safe_load("""
    - criticality: error
      check:
        function: is_not_null
        arguments:
          col_names:
            - col1
            - col2
    """)

    status = DQEngine.validate_checks(checks)

  <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI">
    Validate checks stored in the installation folder:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx validate-checks --run-config "default"
    ```

    The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' will be used by default:
    - 'checks_file': relative location of the quality rules defined as `yaml` or `json` inside the installation folder (default: `checks.yml`).
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Data Quality Dashboard

The data quality dashboard is automatically installed in the `dashboards` folder of the workspace installation directory when you install DQX in the Databricks workspace. For more details on the installation process, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

The dashboard lets you monitor and track data quality issues easily. You can customize them to align with your specific requirements.

The dashboard is not scheduled to refresh automatically by default, minimizing concerns regarding associated cluster costs. When you open a dashboard, refresh it manually to view the latest data. However, as needed, you can configure the dashboard to [refresh periodically](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dashboards/index.html#schedules-and-subscriptions).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="CLI" label="CLI" default>
    You can locate the dashboard using Databricks workspace UI directly or use the following command:
    ```commandline
    databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
    ```

    After executing the command:
    * Locate and click on a dashboard file in the workspace UI.
    * Open the dashboard and click `Refresh` to load the latest data.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    You can locate the dashboard using Databricks workspace UI directly or use the following code:
    ```python
    from databricks.labs.dqx.contexts.workspace import WorkspaceContext

    ctx = WorkspaceContext(WorkspaceClient())
    dashboards_folder_link = f"{ctx.installation.workspace_link('')}dashboards/"
    print(f"Open a dashboard from the following folder and refresh it:")
    print(dashboards_folder_link)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Dashboard configuration">
DQX dashboard(s) only use the quarantined table for queries as defined in `config.yml` during installation.
If you change the quarantine table in the run config after the deployment (`quarantine_table` field), you must update the dashboard queries accordingly.
</Admonition>

## Additional Configuration

### Customizing Reporting Error and Warning Columns

By default, DQX appends `_error` and `_warning` reporting columns to the output DataFrame to flag quality issues.

You can customize the names of these reporting columns by specifying additional configurations in the engine.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python" label="Python" default>
    ```python
    from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
    from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import (
        DQEngine,
        ExtraParams,
    )

    # customize reporting column names
    extra_parameters = ExtraParams(column_names={"errors": "dq_errors", "warnings": "dq_warnings"})

    ws = WorkspaceClient()
    dq_engine = DQEngine(ws, extra_params=extra_parameters)
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
