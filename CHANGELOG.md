## 0.4.0

* Added input spark options and schema for reading from the storage ([#312](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/312)). This commit enhances the data quality framework used for profiling and validating data in a Databricks workspace with new options and functionality for reading data from storage. It allows for the usage of input spark options and schema, and supports fully qualified Unity Catalog or Hive Metastore table names in the format of catalog.schema.table or schema.table. Additionally, the code now includes a new dataclass field, input_schema, and a new dictionary field, input_read_options, to the RunConfig class. The documentation is updated with examples of how to use the new functionality.
* Added an example of uniqueness check for composite key ([#312](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/312)). Additionally, the code now includes a new dataclass field, input_schema, and a new dictionary field, input_read_options, to the RunConfig class. The documentation is updated with examples of how to use the new functionality.
* Renamed row checks module for more clarity ([#314](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/314)). This change renames the `col_check_functions` module to `row_checks` for clarity and to distinguish it from other types of checks. The `import *` syntax is removed and unused imports are removed from the demo. This change requires updating import statements that reference `col_check_functions` to use the new name `row_checks`. Checks defined using DQX classes require a simple update.

## 0.3.1

* Removed usage of lambda in quality checking ([#310](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/310)). We have replaced the usage of lambda functions n the quality checking with a more efficient implementation, and updated the method to handle optional arguments in validation. These changes improve the performance of the quality checking.

## 0.3.0

* Added sampling to the profiler ([#303](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/303)). The profiler's performance has been significantly improved in this release through the addition of sampling and limiting the input data. The profiler now samples input data with a 30% sampling factor and limits the number of records to 1000 by default, reducing the amount of data processed and enhancing performance. These changes are configurable and can be customized. This resolves issue [#215](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/215).
* Added support for complex column types like struct, map and array. The support is added by extending the col_name to accept expressions ([#214](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/214)). Comprehensive examples have been included in the demo and documentation on how to apply checks on complex types.
* Fixed profiler bug when trying to cast a decimal string to int ([#211](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/211)). This modification resolves issue [#172](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/172) and ensures proper handling of decimal strings during the casting process. This enhancement improves the profiler's robustness and flexibility when processing different data types, specifically integers and decimals.
* Renamed DQRule to DQColRule, and DQRuleColSet to DQColSetRule ([#300](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/300)). In this release, the class names `DQRule` and `DQRuleColSet` have been renamed to `DQRuleCol` and `DQColSetRule`, respectively, to support the addition of more rule types in the future, such as `DQDatasetRule`. The renaming includes corresponding changes in imports and method calls throughout the codebase. A deprecation warning has been added to the old classes. In addition, the `col_functions` module has been renamed to `col_check_functions`. This introduces a breaking change!. It is recommended to to update any references to the old class names in your code to ensure a smooth transition.
* Trim autogenerated check name to 255 chars ([#301](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/301)). This change ensures that potential issues arising from long check names are avoided by truncating the auto-generated check name to a reasonable lenght.
* Updated sql expression logic ([#212](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/212)). In this release, the SQL expression logic in our data quality library has been updated to cause the `sql_expression` check to fail if the condition is not met, introducing a potential breaking change.
* Added context info to output ([#206](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/206)). Additional context information is now added to the results of quality checks, including name, message, column name, filter, function, runtime, and user-provided metadata for every failed check. This allows users to provide custom metadata that is stored in the reporting columns for failed checks. This change is a breaking change for checks defined using classes! It is advised to consult the latest documentation for the updated syntax of defining checks using DQX classes.

## 0.2.0

* Added uniqueness check([#200](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/200)). A uniqueness check has been added, which reports an issue for each row containing a duplicate value in a specified column. This resolves issue [154](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/154).
* Added column expression support for limits in not less and not greater than checks, and updated docs ([#200](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/200)). This commit introduces several changes to simplify and enhance data quality checking in PySpark workloads for both streaming and batch data. The naming conventions of rule functions have been unified, and the `is_not_less_than` and `is_not_greater_than` functions now accept column names or expressions as limits. The input parameters for range checks have been unified, and the logic of `is_not_in_range` has been updated to be inclusive of the boundaries. The project's documentation has been improved, with the addition of comprehensive examples, and the contribution guidelines have been clarified. This change includes a breaking change for some of the checks. Users are advised to review and test the changes before implementation to ensure compatibility and avoid any disruptions. Reslves issues: [131](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/131), [197](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/pull/200), [175](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/175), [205](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/205)
* Include predefined check functions by default when applying custom checks by metadata ([#203](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/203)). The data quality engine has been updated to include predefined check functions by default when applying custom checks using metadata in the form of YAML or JSON. This change simplifies the process of defining custom checks, as users no longer need to manually import predefined functions, which were previously required and could be cumbersome. The default behavior now is to import all predefined checks. The `validate_checks` method has been updated to accept a dictionary of custom check functions instead of global variables. This improvement resolves issue [#48](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/48).

## 0.1.13

* Fixed cli installation and demo ([#177](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/177)). In this release, changes have been made to adjust the dashboard name, ensuring compliance with new API naming rules. The dashboard name now only contains alphanumeric characters, hyphens, or underscores, and the reference section has been split for clarity. In addition, demo for the tool has been updated to work regardless if a path or UC table is provided in the config. Furthermore, documentation has been refactored and udpated to improve clarity. The following issue have been closed: [#171](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/171) and [#198](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/198).
* [Feature] Update is_(not)_in_range ([#87](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/87)) to support max/min limits from col ([#153](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/153)). In this release, the `is_in_range` and `is_not_in_range` quality rule functions have been updated to support a column as the minimum or maximum limit, in addition to a literal value. This change is accomplished through the introduction of optional `min_limit_col_expr` and `max_limit_col_expr` arguments, allowing users to specify a column expression as the minimum or maximum limit. Extensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests, has been conducted to ensure the correct behavior of the new functionality. These enhancements offer increased flexibility when defining quality rules, catering to a broader range of use cases and scenarios.


## 0.1.12

* Fixed installation process for Serverless ([#150](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/150)). This commit removes the pyspark dependency from the library to avoid spark version conflicts in Serverless and future DBR versions. CLI has been updated to install pyspark for local command execution.
* Updated demos and documentation ([#169](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/169)). In this release, the quality checks in the demos have been updated to better showcase the capabilities of DQX. Documentation has been updated in various places for increased clarity. Additional contributing guides have been added.


## 0.1.11

* Provided option to customize reporting column names ([#127](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/127)). In this release, the DQEngine library has been enhanced to allow for customizable reporting column names. A new constructor has been added to DQEngine, which accepts an optional ExtraParams object for extra configurations. A new Enum class, DefaultColumnNames, has been added to represent the columns used for error and warning reporting. New tests have been added to verify the application of checks with custom column naming. These changes aim to improve the customizability, flexibility, and user experience of DQEngine by providing more control over the reporting columns and resolving issue [#46](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/46).
* Fixed parsing error when loading checks from a file ([#165](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/165)). In this release, we have addressed a parsing error that occurred when loading checks (data quality rules) from a file, fixing issue [#162](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/162). The specific issue being resolved is a SQL expression parsing error. The changes include refactoring tests to eliminate code duplication and improve maintainability, as well as updating method and variable names to use `filepath` instead of "path". Additionally, new unit and integration tests have been added and manually tested to ensure the correct functionality of the updated code.
* Removed usage of try_cast spark function from the checks to make sure DQX can be run on more runtimes ([#163](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/163)). In this release, we have refactored the code to remove the usage of the `try_cast` Spark function and replace it with `cast` and `isNull` checks to improve code compatibility, particularly for runtimes where `try_cast` is not available. The affected functionality includes null and empty column checks, checking if a column value is in a list, and checking if a column value is a valid date or timestamp. We have added unit and integration tests to ensure functionality is working as intended. 
* Added filter to rules so that you can make conditional checks ([#141](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dqx/issues/141)). The filter serves as a condition that data must meet to be evaluated by the check function. The filters restrict the evaluation of checks to only apply to rows that meet the specified conditions. This feature enhances the flexibility and customizability of data quality checks in the DQEngine.
